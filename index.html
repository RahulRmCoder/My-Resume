    <h1><b>ABOUT</b></h1>
    <p>I am first year student pursuing B. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Jain (Deemed to be University) Kanakapura Campus, Bengaluru and looking forward to have new experiences , to meet new people and to learn new things. I want to make the world a much more peaceful, smoother and technologically more advanced through the practical implementation of my learning and using my skills.
        I am having a big dream to learn many coding languages, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, full stack development etc... and I 
         started to follow my dream by choosing Computer Science in 11th and 12th (CBSE). The language they taught us was Python. I also got an opportunity to learn basics of Structured Query Language (SQL) as it was a part of 12th standard curriculum. Also I learnt Java and C languages as a part of my college curriculum. 
        I have also successfully completed a Web Development course in collaboration with IIT Roorkee through which I have good amount of knowledge regarding HTML, CSS and Java Script. I also got an opportunity to do a project regarding Web Development and I have completed it successfully.
        Along with my engineering classes, I am doing a course named 'CEE - IIT Madras - Advanced Certification in Data Science and AI'. It is a seven month course. And I am not going to stop with this course, I will be learning more and more concepts related to Computer Science.</p>
